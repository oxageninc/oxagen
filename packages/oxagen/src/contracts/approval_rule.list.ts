// list_approval_rules — the workspace's auto-approval rules with what each one
// has done in the last 30 days. The read behind Tools › Auto-approvals
// (MC spec §6.9 part 2, ADR-070).
//
// A console read is outside the metering surface (ADR-052 exclusion 2), so the
// contract declares `noBillingGate: true`; `mutates: false` is what lets the
// app's `kernelRead` accept it.
//
// The two counters are computed from `agent.approval_requests` over the window
// rather than kept in a rollup: they count the rows a rule was read against,
// and the rule set holds tens of rules, so the grouped count is the figure
// itself with nothing to fall out of date. What they do and do not count is on
// `skipped30d` below.
