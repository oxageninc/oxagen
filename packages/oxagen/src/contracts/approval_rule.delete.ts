// delete_approval_rule — take one auto-approval rule out of the workspace's
// rule set (MC spec §6.9 part 2; ADR-070).
//
// The Tools page offers "switch off instead" beside it, because a rule that is
// off keeps its id and so keeps the 30-day counters and every receipt that
// cites it readable. Deleting is for a rule that was a mistake.
