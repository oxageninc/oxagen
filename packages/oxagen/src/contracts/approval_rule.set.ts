// set_approval_rules — write the workspace's auto-approval rules (MC spec
// §6.9 part 2, App. E; ADR-070). Create and edit are the same write: the
// caller sends the whole set and it replaces the stored clause atomically, so
// two rules can never disagree about which one a call matched first.
//
// `agent.requiresApproval: true`: an agent that asks to widen the conditions
// under which its own calls skip a person waits for one. `noBillingGate: true`:
// writing governance is settings, not a governed action (ADR-052 exclusion 2).
//
// The handler refuses a rule whose tool patterns match no declared tool, whose
// measures the matched tools do not declare, or whose consequences the caller
// does not hold the org role for — the spec's rule that a rule cannot be saved
// that would widen an agent past its operator's grants.
