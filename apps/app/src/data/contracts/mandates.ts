// the page wrong about the only thing it is for, and a boundary is the
// cheapest place for one to disagree and the hardest place to notice — which
// is how `isEffective` shipped reporting live authority for the one instant at
// `validTo` while the gate was already denying. Each is listed with what it
// mirrors, whether it provably matches, and which way it errs when it cannot.
//
// - `isEffective` / `isUpcoming` — mirror `findCoveringMandate`'s status and
//   window clauses (`packages/rules/src/mandates.ts:467-472`). Provably match:
//   the window is half-open at both ends and every boundary instant is pinned,
//   including the handover between the two predicates at `validFrom`. They do
//   not mirror the gate's consequence-coverage and tool-pattern clauses, on
//   purpose — those are questions about a call, and no call is named here.
// - `EVERY_TOOL` (`@/ui/mandate-scope`) — decides that a mandate covers every
//   tool. Provably sound: `toolMatches` reaches `matchGlob`, which returns
//   true for the literal pattern `*` before any conversion
//   (`packages/mcp-config/src/permissions.ts:65`). Not complete — `**` would
//   also match everything and renders as its literal text instead. That under-
//   claims, leaving the reader the pattern to judge, which is the direction
//   that cannot mislead.
// - `ACCOUNTABLE_READERS` (below) — a copy of `ACCOUNTABLE_ORG_ROLES` in
//   `packages/handlers/src/_mandate.ts` that **cannot be made to match** from
//   here, because the handler never reports whether it narrowed. It is written
//   to err toward hedging, and the durable answer is a visibility flag on
//   `list_mandates`' own output (ARCHITECTURE.md §9), not a better copy.
// - The retirement gate (`features/agents/mandates.tsx`) — the page declines to
//   offer a request that `request_mandate` would accept, because retirement
//   suspends the principal and the handler does not resolve that status. The
//   app is deliberately stricter than the kernel; closing it on the other
//   surfaces is filed as #3124.
// - The bounds block below — copies of the request schemas, each naming its
//   rule and each pinned by an assertion that quotes the rule as a literal
//   rather than importing the copy under test.

// ── The contract bounds this app mirrors ──────────────────────────────────
