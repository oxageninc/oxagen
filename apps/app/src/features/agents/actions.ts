/**
 * Asks for a mandate on this agent's behalf. The handler records a draft for
 * the role accountable for the consequence to grant or decline; a draft grants
 * nothing, because the gate reads active mandates only.
 *
 * **This form never multiplies a limit.** A limit is stored in the units the
 * ledger records, and which those are is a property of the tool version's
 * declaration, not of the request: micros for an `amount`, whole units for a
 * `count` (INV-09). The gate reads the call by that declaration — `readMeasure`
 * in packages/rules/src/mandates/measures.ts converts an amount to micros and
 * takes a count as whole units — and compares it against the stored limit as
 * an integer.
 *
 * The declaration is not reachable from here, and nothing downstream catches a
 * request that disagrees with it. `measureDeclarationsSchema` is an input of
 * `publish_tool_declaration` and appears in no output; `list_tool_declarations`
 * answers the version and checksum and no `measures`; `get_agent_toolbelt`
 * carries none; and reading `agent.tool_versions` is banned (INV-05).
 * `assertToolsDeclareMeasures` (packages/handlers/src/_mandate.ts) refuses a
 * measure that is undeclared or `text` and never compares its `type` to
 * anything the request states, so a grant does not check the scaling either.
 *
 * Being wrong in the two directions is not symmetric, which is what decides
 * this:
 *
 *   scaled, declared a `count`   50 stored as 50000000, read as 50,000,000
 *                                counts — a millionfold MORE authority than
 *                                was typed, silently.
 *   verbatim, declared an `amount`  50 stored as "50", read as 50 micros — a
 *                                millionfold LESS. The call is denied and a
 *                                person sees it.
 *
 * Only the first is a silent over-grant, and a mandate is bounded authority: a
 * form that can store a wider bound than the operator entered is a worse
 * failure than a form that cannot express every bound. So the figure typed is
 * the figure stored, digit for digit. A money limit is correct only once the
 * declaration confirms the measure is an `amount`, so it is not requestable
 * here — it is requestable over the API and MCP, where the caller holds the
 * declaration, and the app reads one back as money either way.
 *
 * The durable fix is `measures` on `list_tool_declarations`' output: with it
 * the form resolves the declaration for the named measure across the tools its
 * patterns match, defaults from it, refuses a mismatch, and can scale an
 * amount because it knows it is one. That is `list_tool_declarations`' object
 * and not this lane's (ARCHITECTURE.md §9).
