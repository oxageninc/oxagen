// Typed Organization values for the Organization component tests
// (ARCHITECTURE.md §5): a role row, a catalogue entry, the roles read, a
// workspace row, one API key, and a DataSource that answers the four
// organization reads with what a test hands it while recording the arguments
// it was called with. Every other port refuses, so a section that reads
// outside its own port fails the test rather than passing on a stub.
// Importable from tests only (`testOnlyTarget` in src/test/arch/layers.ts).
