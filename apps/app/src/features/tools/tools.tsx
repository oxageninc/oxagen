// Tools (#2958, #2957; ARCHITECTURE.md §1.2, mockup `mockups/pages/tools.md`):
// the registry of tool versions with their safety classification, the
// credential grants the broker minted, the kill switches reaching this
// workspace, the ledger of every mandate the workspace has granted, and the
// auto-approval rules that let a call skip a person (ADR-070).
//
// Five tabs, because five of the mockup's six are backed today. #2958 shipped
// the shell and the first three and left the slot this comment described;
// #2957's ledger filled it, and Auto-approvals arrived the same way: its name
// in TOOLS_TABS, its case below, and nothing else moved. Policy is still its
// own lane.
//
// Each tab makes only the reads it shows, except the switch count on the tab
// strip: a count in navigation appears where something waits on a person, and
// a switch that is denying is exactly that. The kernel seam serves one read
// per request, so the switches tab does not pay for that count twice.

/**
 * The same org roles, for the import control — and the contradiction behind
 * that, because a gate that merely looked exact here would hide it.
 *
 * `import_tools` declares `workspace: { Owner: "allow" }` and its handler
 * asserts `workspace: ["Owner"]` (packages/handlers/src/tool.import.ts:141),
 * so on paper this workspace's Owner may import whatever their org role. No
 * person can satisfy that clause. `assertOrgRole` resolves a workspace role
 * from `iam.principal_role_assignments`, and nothing in the tree writes one
 * for a human: `workspace-bootstrap.ts` records the creator in
 * `workspace.workspace_users` and assigns no IAM role,
 * `iam-provision.ts` creates the workspace-scoped roles and hands them to
 * nobody, and the one insert setting a non-null `workspace_id`
 * (`agent.role.assign.ts`) refuses human system roles. The org half has no
 * such gap — every path writing `org_users.role` writes the matching IAM
 * assignment in the same transaction — which is why `ctx.orgRole` is a
 * faithful proxy for what the handler will find and `ctx.wsRole` is not.
 *
 * So this reads only the role that is enforceable. Widening it to
 * `ctx.wsRole === "owner"` would promise authority nothing can grant, and
 * would promise it to a viewer who cannot reach the control anyway:
 * `list_tool_versions` asserts the same empty workspace clause, so an org
 * `member` is denied the registry read and `Registry` answers `ReadFailure`
 * before `ImportControls` is reached.
 *
 * The gate is not the decision. Whether workspace membership should confer
 * IAM authority at all — for this capability and the 215 others declaring a
 * `workspace:` clause — is #3198, and it wants an ADR. When that lands, this
 * reads `ctx.wsRole` again and `tools.test.tsx` derives from the full
 * `defaultRoles` rather than the org clause alone.
