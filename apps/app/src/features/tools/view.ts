// Which Tools view a request asks for (#2958): a tab, a category chip on
// Registry, the labels/API-names toggle and a cursor, all from the query
// string. A tab is a query rather than a route (ARCHITECTURE.md §1.2: this
// lane adds no route), and a value the page does not know falls back to the
// default rather than failing the page.
//
// Five of the mockup's six tabs are backed today: the three #2958's
// capabilities back, the Mandates ledger #2957 brought, and Auto-approvals
// over the ADR-070 rule set. Policy is still its own lane; it adds its name to
// TOOLS_TABS and its case to the body, and nothing else here moves.
