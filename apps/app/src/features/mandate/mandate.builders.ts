// A DataSource answering the mandate page's one read (ARCHITECTURE.md §5), and
// nothing else: the page reads `get_mandate` alone, so every other port refuses
// and a test that accidentally reaches for one fails rather than passing on a
// stub. The mandate values themselves come from `@/test/mandate-views`, which
// four features share because no feature may reach into another's folder.
// Importable from tests only (`testOnlyTarget` in src/test/arch/layers.ts).
