# list_approval_rules

**Domain:** approval_rule
**Mode:** sync
**Scope:** tenant + workspace
**Surfaces:** api, mcp
**Sensitivity:** medium
**Metering:** none (`noBillingGate`, a console read)
**App:** Tools › Auto-approvals at `/{org}/{ws}/tools?tab=autoapprovals`: the rules table and its three totals. An org Owner, Admin or Compliance sees it.

## Intent

The workspace's auto-approval rules — the conditions under which a call a
policy sent to a person may skip them — with what each one has done in the
last 30 days. The read behind Tools › Auto-approvals.

## Input

Takes no argument. The rule set is a workspace's, and it is small enough to
return whole.

## Output

`{ items: ApprovalRule[], windowDays: number }`.

A rule (spec §6.9 part 2): `id` (the slug a receipt cites as
`policy:<id>`), `name`, `tools` (globs over a declared tool's `slug@version`
or its bare slug), `enabled`, `maxMeasures` (measure → an inclusive integer
ceiling, micros for a currency), `allowTargets` (measure → the globs its
target must match), `standingWindowMs` (the window in which a person's
approval of the same call digest re-applies, or null), `businessHours`
(`{ timezone, days, start, end }` local to the rule's own zone, or null),
`createdBy` (`usr_…`), `createdAt`, and `authoredConsequences` — the effective
consequence tags the rule's tools carried when it was last written, which the
evaluation compares a call's tool against so a tool classified afterwards
cannot be auto-approved under a rule nobody was accountable for.

Beside each rule, over `windowDays` (30): `hits30d`, the calls it released
with no person, and `skipped30d`, the calls that reached a person's queue with
this rule recorded beside them. Both are counted from
`agent.approval_requests`, so they are the record rather than a rollup of it,
and both count only calls that produced an approval row. A decision rule's
`require_approval` verdict that no auto-approval rule released writes no such
row — the gate refuses the call rather than queueing it — so it appears in
neither figure; what is counted is every call a mandate parked.

## Readers

An org Owner, Admin or Compliance.
